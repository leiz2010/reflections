Commit when there is a logical change in the file.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Multipe files in one commit is better for software project where code is split into different file. Google Docs files are not depended on each other to work like a software project would.
